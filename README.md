## Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Decision Trees
* The provided dataset contains a feature space that describes various odorant molecules. It contains 184 numerical features describing physico-chemical parameters of 627 odorants. The target values indicate whether an odorant has a "fruity" smell.
* Hyperparameter tunning is done for Logisctic regression, Decision tree and random forest.
* The models are compared using various performance metrics and the best model is chosen.
